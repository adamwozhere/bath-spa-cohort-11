        <p>
            After studying Animation at the University of Portsmouth, I began working as a freelance motion graphics designer. <br/>
            Finding the work wasn't sustainable for me due to anxiety, I looked into transfering my skills elsewhere;
            during the pandemic I experimented again with animation and illustration -- 
            I then decided to create a new portfolio website, which took me down the rabbit hole of learning web development.
