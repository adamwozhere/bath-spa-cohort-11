        The rocket takes off and blasts into space. Everything is fine until
        there is a bleeping noise. You look at the sceen and it says
        <br />
        <strong>WARNING: SOMETHING WENT WRONG</strong>.<br />
        That sounds really bad doesn't it. You're probably going to die. What
        are you going to do?
