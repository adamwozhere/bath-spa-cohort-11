        Wow your Dad's filthy rich. <br />
        OK so Dad builds a rocket for fun, and goes into space for a few mins,
        then flies back down again. That's super cool and pointless at the same
        time. I guess now he builds a bigger better one and takes some people to
        Mars. You better put your seatbelt on.
